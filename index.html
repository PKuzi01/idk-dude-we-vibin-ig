        <p>You ever get to a point where there was no way you could do something because the reality of how hard it would be to achieve the end result of the thing was a lot greater and sitting in front of your face? So like a bitch, you turn tail and never click on the VSCode icon on your taskbar because "you'll never be the creative programmer you wanted to be, you're just not good enough"? But it's not just that either. It's the idea that you have to become some kind of monolith to be successful, and all you've been is a person who wants to do all of it but is constantly told they can't, and so they believe it in the end. Sure, if I pursue all the things I actually wanted to do, I'd have difficulty sleeping for different reasons, but to be convinced out of pursuing them because of the idea that you have be a person devoid of passion, solely focussing on just the one thing until you can survive and be able to buy bread and pay rent, until you're not a disappointment to your parents, until you can avoid the drugs and alcohol, and most of all, not only do you not know how to ask for help, you hate doing it because you were told that if you can't rely on yourself, you are a burden.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, I wanna be cool. And cool people do stuff. And they do that stuff despite the consistent yapping in their heads, and the doubt, and maybe even a little guilt because of the thought that you shouldn't have the feeling that you could and should do more. They just do it, and they enjoy their time in the space they create for themselves. Actually, I want to be my version of human, which is what cool is to me, which is enough. So we're coding again I guess. And a percentage of my human will be that I can make stuff and evolve in it. Which is better way to go through life, I think. It seems less miserable.</p>
